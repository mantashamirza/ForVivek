    <h1>For Vivek — From Mantasha</h1>
    <div class="sub">ConstaCloud brought us together. This is a little memory I made from that cloud.</div>

    <blockquote>
      “We coded our days apart, but your voice compiled my heart — <strong>one small function</strong> and everything changed.”
    </blockquote>

    <div class="verse">A short story</div>
    <p>We were in different cities, working on the same project. You as the developer, me as the manager — deadlines, remote calls, and long evenings. The job tested us, but your voice gave me a reason to smile. What began as work became my refuge. Today, every calm from you is a home I recognize.</p>

    <div class="note">
      “The best bug ConstaCloud ever gave me was you.”
    </div>

    <div class="verse">From ConstaCloud to You</div>
    <p>We met through clouds, not skies or chance,<br>
      Two souls apart, yet caught in the same dance.<br>
      Your voice was the calm my chaos knew,<br>
      A gentle echo that quietly grew.<br>
      
      ConstaCloud wasn’t kind, it tested my way,<br>
      But gave me the reason my heart chose to stay.<br>
      In that storm of work, deadlines, and blue,<br>
      I lost myself… only to find you.<br>
      </p>

    <a class="btn" href="#" onclick="document.getElementById('reveal').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">Reveal My Birthday Promise</a>

    <div id="reveal" style="display:none; margin-top:16px;">
      <p><strong>Birthday Promise:</strong> <p><strong>Birthday Promise:</strong>  
I once disappeared without a reason, leaving a story half-written.  
And yet, when I returned, you opened the same page with a smile, not a question.  
Your kindness healed something I didn’t know was broken.  
So here’s my promise, I’ll never let fear write our pauses again.  
You deserve love that stays, not love that visits.  
Happy Birthday, Vivek from the girl who found her calm in your kindness, and her forever in your heart.</p>
